# Equipment Funding Policy

As an **internal staff member** you can request the purchase of equipment you’ll use for work such as a laptop, headset, webcam, monitor, mouse, keyboard, desk, an office chair, etc. provided you agree to the conditions below.


## Earned Value and Budget

You **earn value** at a rate of 2% of your rate per hour since the moment you join. So if you earned X over a given period of time you have earned 0.02 * X towards equipment purchase.

The total purchase price of all equipment the company buys for you to use **must not exceed** $3k (net of VAT) plus your total Earned Value.

$Total Purchase Price \leq \\$3000 + Earned Value + Excess Cofunding$

You can request **additional equipment** at any time as long as the total purchase price does not exceed this limit.

You can **co-fund better equipment** by paying the excess immediately. The company will invoice you.

## Remaining Value and Transfer of Ownership

At any time you can purchase the equipment by paying the **Remaining Value** of company equipment you’re using calculated as the purchase price minus any co-funding you paid minus your Earned Value up to that point.

$Remaining Value = Total Purchase Price - Earned Value - Excess Cofunding$

If you leave the company you **must buy** the equipment by paying the Remaining Value. The company will invoice you.

If the remaining value reaches zero the company will **transfer ownership** of the equipment to you.

The hardware is **never returned**. In all cases, it remains with you. If the equipment contains sensitive company data you’re responsible for disposing of it securely.

You are responsible for any tax implications of acquiring the equipment according to your local tax laws.

## Transition

If you’re using any company equipment purchased under the prior co-funding policy you can choose to use this new policy instead.
